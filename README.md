## Reflections

#### No component library
I decided to not use existing react component libraries like material ui because I believe building those components on my own would be a good learning experience.

#### Why tailwind
I used tailwind to speed up development time as it keeps styling and markup in one place.

#### Why Firebase
I decided to use firebase as my focus is in front end development and I did not want to spend time learning back end at this time. Although it is something I eventually plan on doing.
