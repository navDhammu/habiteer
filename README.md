Habiteer is a habit tracking web app that helps users build and maintain good habits through progress tracking and data visualization.

## Why?

Many people use fitness trackers to log their workouts, I wondered, why not have something similar for tracking your everyday habits? After some research I noticed there are habit tracking apps for android and ios but very few and with limited functionality for the web. So I decided to make a web based habit tracker that allows you to track your habits directly from the browser.
